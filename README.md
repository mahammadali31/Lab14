This project demonstrates a Java-based application built using Spring Boot, leveraging JPA entities and their relationships to manage data within a relational database.  Initial data population is handled through YAML files, simplifying setup and configuration.  Security is a key aspect, implemented using JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. This allows for secure API access, with distinct roles and permissions for users and administrators.  Upon successful authentication, JWTs are issued, granting access to protected endpoints. Users and admins have different levels of access to various endpoints, reflecting their roles.  Authentication is handled by verifying the JWT presented in the Authorization header of requests.  Database connectivity is managed seamlessly through JPA.  This project showcases best practices for data management, security, and API design within a Spring Boot environment, with a focus on robust authentication and authorization.
